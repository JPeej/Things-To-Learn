# Things-To-Learn 

I am studying Computer Science online at WGU. It has been a great resource, however; I have a healthy anxiety that believes I am missing out on what a live discussion from a professor who once worked professoinaly can give. This is a good thing but I need to stay organized. This list will contain both things I need to learn and things I need to do. My list is my list. It may seem small to others and to others way too big. I will add as I explore multiple references via, [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/), [r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/), and various blog posts. At first it may be unorganized as I won't even understand what category certain topics fall under. I will try my best.
